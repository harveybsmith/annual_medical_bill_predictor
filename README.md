# Build and deploy machine learning web app using TPOT and Streamlit

This app uses the python library TPOT to build optimized machine learning models with minimal lines of code.  It is designed for productivity and continuous integration, continous development.

The model is then deployed with Streamlit, a library in Python that allows for simpler deployment of an interactive frontend space for the user.

The machine learning algorithm used is a catogical boost ensemble algorithm.  All 7 features were used.  Label encoding on Sex, smoker, and region columns.
