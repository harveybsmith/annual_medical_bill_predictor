# Build and deploy machine learning web app using PyCaret and Streamlit

This app uses the python library Pycaret to both easily explore the data, create new features and train the features using cross validation. The library makes all of this rather simple with minimal lines of code.  The emphasis is on simplicity and effencieny in a 
production environment, saving time.

The model is then deployed with Streamlit, a library in Python that allows for simpler deployment of an interactive frontend space for the user.

The machine learning algorithm used is a simple linear regression model
